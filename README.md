I've been wanting to learn full stack development for many years. My passion for creating web pages began in the mid-90s, with websites like Geocities.com, Angelfire.com, and Tripod.com. LIfe got in the way, and eventually found myself in an IT career, but on the infrastructure support side of things. I've tried a few bootcamps here or there, and finally just recently found theodinproject.com. Thanks to TOP, I can finally learn the technologies necessary to have a successful career in full stack web development.
